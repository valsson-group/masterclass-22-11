For this tutorial you will need versions of PLUMED (with the VES module enabled) and GROMACS that are compiled using the MPI library. 
All the exercises were tested with PLUMED version 2.8.0 and GROMACS 2020.6. In order to obtain the these versions, 
please follow the instructions at [this link](https://github.com/plumed/masterclass-2022).
