# PLUMED Masterclass-22-11
Simulation files for PLUMED [Masterclass](https://www.plumed.org/masterclass)-22-11 on how to run variationally enhanced sampling simulations with PLUMED.

The slides from the lecture on July 4, 2022 can be found [here](https://github.com/valsson-group/masterclass-22-11/blob/main/Slides/PLUMED-Masterclass-22-11-July4-2022.pdf)

The tutorial can be found [here](https://www.plumed.org/doc-master/user-doc/html/masterclass-22-11.html). 

For this tutorial you will need versions of PLUMED (with the VES module enabled) and GROMACS that are compiled using the MPI library. 
All the exercises were tested with PLUMED version 2.8.0 and GROMACS 2020.6. In order to obtain the these versions, 
please follow the instructions at [this link](https://github.com/plumed/masterclass-2022).
